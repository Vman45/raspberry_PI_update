bluetooth physical address:
RPI_ble1 DC:A6:32:69:CC:94
RPI_ble2 DC:A6:32:2A:13:51


sudo btmon | grep RSSI


With another PRI discoverable, use this to get the signal strength
hcitool rssi 

Assumption:
seems that the hcitool can only use when the blt device is discoverable 
but the bluetoothctl scan can catch any bluetooth signal ??? Is'n it ??
